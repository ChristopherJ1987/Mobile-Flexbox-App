            <p>Tanjiro Kamado (竈門かまど 炭たん治じ郎ろう Kamado Tanjirō?) is the main protagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.</p>

            <p>He is a Demon Slayer in the Demon Slayer Corps, who joined to find a remedy to turn his sister, Nezuko Kamado, back into a human and to hunt down and kill demons, and later swore to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji,[6] the King of Demons, in order to prevent others from suffering the same fate as him.</p>

            <img src="/images/tanjiro.jpg">

            Before he became a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro was a coal burner before his entire family was slaughtered by Muzan while his younger sister, Nezuko, was turned into a demon.

            <p>"In order to soothe the spirits of those it killed, and to make sure it claims no further victims... I will swing my blade down and lop off the head of any demon without mercy! But... I will not belittle those who regret their actions and suffer over the things they did as demons. Because demons were once human. Because they were like me."</p>
